The _printf function is a special printing tool that mimics the behavior of the regular 
printf function in the C programming language. It lets you print different types of information 
with specific formats.

How to use command:
int my_printf(const char *format, ...);

Types of specifiers you can use:

%c: Prints a single character.

%s: Prints a group of characters (a string).

%%: Prints a percent sign (%).

%d and %i: Print whole numbers (integers).
